# tic-tac-toe
Amateur python program to play tic-tac-toe against pc.
The first version of this, which I did during my second month of learning Python programming, features a pretty 'dumb' pc opponent that randomly chooses any empty cell to play in.
The second version (updated a year and a half later when revisitng some Python) features a somewhat more 'intelligent' pc that plays either offense or defense, context dependant.
Procedural programming, lots of functions, over 100 lines of code.
Still looking to make the code more elegant.
